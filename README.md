# JpegViewer

JpegViewer is a lightweight desktop application that displays JPEG images from a selected folder in a simple, fast, and user-friendly interface. It’s designed for quick browsing and viewing of photos without the overhead of full-featured photo-management software.

# Usage:
- Open folder using the top left menu button. Note that only the first image will appear in the view (if all goes well).
- Small picture icons will pop up in the timeline view, marking groups or single images.
- You can move the timeline left - right by mouse wheel or by simply dragging it or with the scrollbar on the bottom.
- You can zoom in/out the timeline by Ctrl + mouse wheel. Note that this functionality is not complete. There are 6 zoom levels: years, months, days, hours, minutes and seconds.
- Showing the image that belongs to the timeline center point is not working yet. Always the first image of the opened folder is shown.
- Top-right menu is not functioning. It's still just an example, where later the main menu can be implemented.
